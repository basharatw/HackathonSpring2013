/*   Blocked User and Blocing User */
/* This Query uses our "Admin" as the datebase name - Change where ever aplicable.
 * Version : 0.0

 * Author : 
 * Lot of this was Hacked together from lot of individual pieces from the forums
 * This script displays the blocks/deadlocks in the Database as the application is being run.
 * There are 2 parts to this script. 
 * 1. The first sql returns any blocks occuring on the Database displaying:
 *              Object locked, Blocked User, Blocking User, etc
 * 2. The second sql returns information about the resource causing the blocking.
 *      Information displayed includes user holding the lock, lock type and lock granularity 
 
 * More will be added later ---- next hack
 *  I tried to keep it as much TSQL as I could
